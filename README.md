  <h1>Welcome to my Profile</h1>
  <p>Hey there! I'm Muhammad Ali, a CS student on a quest to learn, create, and maybe even break a few things along the way. This GitHub profile is my digital magic book, filled with spells (code!), potions (projects!), and perhaps a lurking troll or two (bugs!).</p>
  <h2>Here's a peek into my digital alchemy:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Skills: Proficient in Python and Web Scrapping and currently brewing knowledge in Deep Learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Languages: I speak fluent python & java and am always eager to learn a new dialect!</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>âœ¨ Open to Collaboration!</h2>
  <p>I'm always looking to learn from others and tackle new challenges. Feel free to reach out if you have a project in mind or just want to chat about code!</p> 
  <h2>You can find me at:</h2>
